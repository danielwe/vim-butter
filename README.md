# vim-butter: Buttery smooth buffer browsing in vim

If you make frequent use of vim buffer navigation commands like `:bnext`, perhaps even
to the point where you `nmap <Right> :bnext<CR>`, you've probably had some unpleasant
experiences: losing access to open help buffers, seeing stale location lists and file
explorer buffers appear out of nowhere, and so on. `vim-butter` is lubrication for vim
buffer navigation.

## Navigate buffers

`:[S]Bnext,:[S]Bprev,:[S]BNext,:[S]Blast,:[S]Bfirst,:[S]Brewind`

The plugin provides a new family of commands, `:Bnext` and friends, that mirror the
standard ones but apply two additional heuristics to decide what to do:

1. Only ever open a buffer of the same kind as the current buffer;
1. Don't touch the preview window.

Specifically:

* If you're in an ordinary file buffer (i.e., `buftype` is `""` and buffer is listed),
  `:Bnext` will open the next ordinary buffer.
* If you're in a help buffer (i.e., `buftype` is `"help"` and  buffer is unlisted),
  `:Bnext` will open the next help buffer. (Note: this is how `:bnext` is supposed to
  work out of the box according to vim documentation, see
  <http://vimhelp.appspot.com/windows.txt.html#%3Abnext>. This is not how it works in
  practice, and I should get around to reporting the bug.)
* If you're in any other kind of buffer, `:Bnext` will do _nothing at all_. Your buffer
  is considered unique, so another one of the same kind does not exist.
* If you're in a preview window, `:Bnext` will do nothing.

The commands `:Bprev` and `:BNext` step backwards using the same logic, and
`:Blast,:Bfirst,:Brewind` step to the last and first buffers of the same kind,
respectively.

The plugin also provides the commands
`:SBnext,:SBprev,:SBNext,:SBlast,:SBfirst,:SBrewind`, which open the target buffer in a
split. These also work from the preview window.

The commands `[S]Bnext,[S]Bprev,[S]BNext` take an optional count in the line number
position (i.e., `:3Bnext`) specifying how many steps to move down the buffer list. Only
buffers of the same kind as the current buffer are counted.

## Delete buffers

`:Bdelete,:Bunload,:Bwipeout`

The plugin provides commands for deleting buffers using similar heuristics: `:Bdelete N`
will try to hide buffer `N` and replace it with the previous buffer of the same kind
(i.e., call `:Bprev`) in all windows where it is open, and only then call `:bdelete` on
it. Thus, the window layout is maintained unless no other buffer of the same kind is
available. Just as for `:bdelete`, the buffer(s) to delete can be specified in a number
of ways: a single buffer index in the line number position (`:3Bdelete`), a buffer index
range (`3,5Bdelete`), one or more arguments containing buffer indices or filenames
(`Bdelete 3 prose.txt`), or no argument at all (`Bdelete`, applies to current buffer).
Analogous commands `Bunload` and `Bwipeout` are also provided.

A new buffer will never be loaded into the preview window (this is a direct and desired
consequence of using `:Bprev` for the buffer replacement). Hence, if the preview window
is open with a buffer about to be removed, it will be closed.

## Open or go to file

`:Drop`

Finally, `vim-butter` defines the command `:Drop`, an improvement on the `:drop` command
in the spirit of the commands above. It aims to be the sanest way to navigate straight
to a file that may or may not already be open in some window. Like `:drop`, `:Drop` will
jump to the window in which the file is already open, or open it in the current window,
which is split if the current buffer cannot be abandoned. However, `:Drop` adds extra
precautions if the current buffer is special or if the current window is a preview
window: In these cases, it will first move back to the window that was in focus
previously, and if the buffer is still special, the window will be split, as if `:drop`
were called while in a buffer that cannot be abandoned. A special buffer is a buffer
that has a `buftype` other than `""`, or is unlisted.

Give it a try: call `:Drop $MYVIMRC` from a help buffer, preview window or similar.

Note: full functionality of this command requires a vim that has the `:drop` command,
i.e., one that was compiled with either the gui or clientserver options or has patch
8.0.1508. If this is unavailable, `:Drop` will not be able to move to a window where the
file is already open.

## Similar plugins

Other plugins seem to focus on sane buffer removal, while I consider this a nice
collateral of sane buffer browsing, which is the main goal of `vim-butter`.
